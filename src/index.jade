          p
            | Near you is a copy of your past actions, repeating each and every move you took before. We think this is all because of that <span class="energized">fancy energy</span> the white dudes have, and that hitting them unleashes it all in a quick blast.

            | Oh, and one last thing. There should be a way to recover the stolen energy from one of your pasts selves. After all, it all is only lost when the impact with the white fella happens, so maybe if you avoid that from happening somehow...
